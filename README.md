## Usage

To disable or uninstall the Wormhole extension, go to `chrome://extensions`.

## Development

While there are existing extensions that have the same purpose as Wormhole, I didn't like the user interface and wanted to make my own custom extension I can update as I like. Luckily enough, the functionality is simple to implement.
